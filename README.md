#### Created for you, by [@dio.code](https://www.instagram.com/dio.code)

# For whom this theme?
I created this theme for my React Native development. But, you can also use it for any tools.

If you want to customize it, you can add little more code to your `settings.json`.

This is the code that you need to past in a down of setting.

```javascript
"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
   "[@dio.code-dark]": {
      "statusBar.background": "#e1594a",
      "statusBar.foreground": "#dbeeff",
      "editorLineNumber.foreground": "#4e5861",
      "editor.lineHighlightBackground": "#171b20",
      "editorCursor.foreground": "#6c7dff",
   }
}
```
